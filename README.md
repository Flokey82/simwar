# simwar

Package simwar provides a simple war simulation based on Lanchester's Laws. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws

Ultimately, I want to add more features with some additional algorithms and rules for different unit types (archers, artillery, etc), but for now this is just a simple simulation of two armies fighting each other.

Please feel free to contribute :)
